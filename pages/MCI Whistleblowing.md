### MCI Whistleblowing for Grants Administered by MCI

**Overview**

The MCI Whistleblowing Framework for Grants Administered by MCI aims to provide an assurance for responsible and secure whistleblowing in confidence, without fear of reprisals or victimization for whistleblowing in good faith. It provides a platform for individuals to report any possible wrong practices relating to grants administered by MCI, for appropriate investigation and action.

The channels are independently managed by MCI Audit Unit.
