1. What is the Information Service about? What does an Information Officer do?

    The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is the lead agency for the Singapore Government Information Service (IS). As the governmentâ€™s communication specialists, Information Officers are involved in a dynamic and diverse range of Government communications work as follows:

    * Develop strategies to communicate government policies effectively to the public and wider global community in an increasingly challenging communications environment.

    * Engage in public consultation to understand ground sentiments, public perceptions and opinions.

    * Cultivate networks and relationships with local and foreign journalists.

    * Channel government information to both the local and foreign media, allowing them to keep abreast of the latest government policies and decisions.

    * Develop and implement nation building strategies and rally Singaporeans together when the country is threatened by a crisis.

    * Enhance foreign perceptions of Singapore as a cultural and business global city through a variety of channels, publications and online platforms.

3. Do I apply for universities on my own, or will MCI apply on my behalf?

    You should apply for universities, both local and overseas, on your own. This should be done concurrently with your application for all MCI Scholarships.

4. What career development opportunities can I look forward to as a MCI Information Service scholar / Translation scholar?

    Upon graduation, all scholars will join MCI as an Information Officer.

    Information Officers will have the opportunity to work in various capacities in MCI and be seconded to Government Ministries and Statutory Boards to help in communications of policies and programmes.

    As a young officer, you will generally begin your career in MCI where you will receive formal professional and on-the-job training with rotations to divisions and affiliate attachments; or be seconded to serve in the corporate communications department in government agencies. Experienced officers may be seconded to government agencies to assume directorial positions in the public affairs/ corporate communications departments or serve as Press Secretaries to Ministers.

    For Translation scholars, you will generally begin your career in the MCI Translation Department and subsequently be posted to other divisions or public agencies where your language capabilities could be tapped on or for exposure to other areas of information work. Experienced Translation scholars could also be further groomed to assume the role of government translators / interpreters.
