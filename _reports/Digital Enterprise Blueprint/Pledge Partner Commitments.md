---
<p>A trusted, cohesive and digitally resilient ecosystem enables our SMEs
to succeed locally and to expand beyond our borders. It also attracts companies
and investors from abroad to do business with and invest in our SMEs, bringing
in economic value and better jobs. To build such a thriving ecosystem, <strong>collaborations and partnerships are key</strong>.</p>
<p>The Digital Enterprise Blueprint brings together various stakeholders
in the ecosystem (including Government agencies, trade associations and
chambers, tech industry and institutes of higher learning) to provide SMEs
and workers with the right expertise, resources, networks and technologies.</p>
<p>For a start, <strong>seven partners have pledged their commitment</strong> to
the Digital Enterprise Blueprint with various initiatives to support our
enterprises and workers.</p>
<p>They are: <strong>Singapore Business Federation (SBF)</strong>, <strong>Singapore Computer Society (SCS)</strong>, <strong>SGTech</strong>, <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Microsoft </strong>and <strong>Salesforce</strong>.</p>
