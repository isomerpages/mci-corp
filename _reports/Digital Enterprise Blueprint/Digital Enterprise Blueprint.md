<p>The digital landscape is evolving at an unprecedented rate and this rapid
transformation provides limitless opportunities for all. Our enterprises
have made good progress on digitalisation, but we need to stay ahead of
the curve in ensuring that our enterprises remain competitive and our workers
continue to enjoy good jobs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Digital Enterprise Blueprint</strong>, co-created with key
ecosystem stakeholders, sets out our ambition for the next bound of digitalisation
and aims to establish Singapore as a nation of empowered enterprises and
workers. We have identified <strong>four focus areas</strong> to help us
achieve this:</p>
<p>(a) Empower enterprises to <strong><u>Be Smarter</u> </strong>by adopting
AI-enabled solutions,</p>
<p>(b) Enable enterprises to <strong><u>Scale Faster</u> </strong>through
integrated digital solutions,</p>
<p>(c) Equip enterprises to <strong><u>Be Safer</u></strong> through improved
cyber resilience, and</p>
<p>(d) <strong><u>Upskill Workers</u></strong> to make full use of digital
capabilities.</p>
