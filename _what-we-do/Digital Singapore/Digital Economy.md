Infocomm Media
--------------
Infocomm media convergence has changed the way the infocomm and media sector is organised. MCI and IMDA work together to ensure our businesses and people seize the opportunities brought about by this convergence, and that the regulatory environment keep pace with the developments, remains conducive for businesses and protect consumers’ interests.

<h2 id="section1">Introduction to Infocomm Media 2025</h2>

Imagine streaming high-definition web videos smoothly on your tablet PC via free Wi-Fi at Coney Island, while your smartwatch buzzes whenever necessary to notify you of an imminent thunderstorm. This is just one of many possibilities that will be realised with&nbsp;**Infocomm Media 2025**, Singapore’s bold vision for her infocomm media sector.

Developed by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) and the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA), this 10-year plan released in Aug 2015, consists of three strategic thrusts:

1.  Build on the power of data and data insights, advanced communications and computational technologies to catalyse transformation across key sectors of our economy.
2.  Develop a future-ready workforce that embraces risk-taking and innovation.
3.  Deploy infocomm media technologies in a people-centric manner.

Given current technological constraints and pragmatic concerns, realising&nbsp;**Infocomm Media 2025**&nbsp;is not going to be quick and easy. But within the next decade or so, we are confident that Singapore’s research and development (R&amp;D) efforts will pay off, and produce the promising technologies necessary for&nbsp;**Infocomm Media 2025**&nbsp;to be implemented.


<h2 id="section2">Strategic Thrust 1: Capitalise on big data and advanced digital-age technologies</h2>

**Summary**

In order to bring you more personalised services, world-class Internet connectivity all over the island, compelling local TV content and more, hastening Singapore’s transformation into a world-class digital economy is necessary.

This will be done by tapping into the power of big data (the crude oil of the 21st&nbsp;century), and simultaneously establishing a highly advanced and secure infocomm media infrastructure that boosts Singapore’s competitiveness in the global digital economy.

**Challenge #1**

A speedy flow of information to anyone, anywhere, anytime will be the norm in the future. It facilitates better collection, transportation and sharing of data to keep Singapore’s digital economy running. But achieving it is easier said than done, for presently, a number of technological barriers in wireless communications still have to be overcome before our communications infrastructure is ready.&nbsp;

**Challenge #2**

The safety and convenience we enjoy in Singapore relies heavily on technology; government agencies use various sensoring technologies to manage public safety, monitor the environment, control traffic and so forth. But presently, such technologies are compatible only with their own agencies. This does not maximise the use of installation space to gather real-time data anytime, anywhere.

Thus, government bodies will have to synergise their technological efforts in managing Singapore so as to minimise inefficiency as much as possible. When this level of coordination is achieved, you and I can look forward to having more timely information guiding us in our daily activities.

**Challenge #3**

To maintain Singapore’s economic dominance in the age of big data, we have to brand Singapore as a modern digital harbour with world-class Internet connectivity.

As such, building up complementary infrastructure, such as data centres, is key. By doing so, Singapore works her way towards becoming the world’s fastest broadband nation, which will reinforce her position as a regional telecommunications hub, and allow her to continue attracting foreign investments.

However, that is not all. To fill up the digital harbour, the government must also attempt to woo more companies that peddle premium digital content, shared and value-add services (such as business analytics) to anchor their businesses in Singapore.

**Challenge #4**

Shopping at Bugis Junction in the future will be so cashless that thick wallets and purses will be things of the past. The process leading to your purchase of any item will also be so personalised that you will feel the product is trying to fit you, and not the other way around. For such a fantastic shopping experience to be widespread in future, however, we must now encourage entrepreneurship in data-related products and services, namely e-commerce and international logistics.

Getting traditional companies and/or individuals to abandon the inefficient ways of the past can be a slow and painful process, though. We need to instill in them the willingness to learn new things so that they will not be left behind in the digital age.

**Challenge #5**

From healthcare to education, expect many areas of life to be personalised in future with the widespread use of data analytics. This will be the final nail in the coffin for the one-size-fits-all approach that plagues traditional healthcare and educational approaches.

Even better: data analytics will also facilitate the development of robots that can improve our work productivity and augment industry capabilities. Overall, sector-specific competitiveness will increase with advances in data science.

<h2 id="section3">Strategic Thrust 2: Foster risk-taking and willingness to experiment</h2>

**Summary**

A Smart Nation is only as smart as its people in the infocomm media ecosystem. Hence, we have to equip our students and workforce with the essential knowledge and skills they need to perform in high-value infocomm media jobs.

At the same time, we must instill in them the willingness to take risks, and an innovative attitude that would make any dedicated scientist proud. With such “software” installed, Singapore’s infocomm media sector should be capable of producing more successful made-in-Singapore content, products and services.

To further stimulate local creativity, we must create a conducive environment (i.e., a sustainable support network) for aspiring start-ups and growth companies.

**Challenge #1**

Learning is a lifelong journey—this short saying has never rang truer. To survive in the infocomm media ecosystem, members of Singapore’s workforce have to be adaptive and expect constant on-the-fly learning of new Infocomm media knowledge and skills.

For the government’s part, various efforts have to be made to nurture such an ICT-ready workforce. These include grooming our talents from young by promoting technology literacy in school, ensuring that tertiary students are industry-ready via work-study programmes, and talent-retention strategies in industry hiring practices.

**Challenge #2**

Data-driven start-ups and growth companies do not just grow in a vacuum—they are nourished by funding and mentorship. So we have to ensure that these two support options are easily available to said start-ups and companies in the form of sustainable support networks headed by authorities such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA).

These networks should ideally also include other support options, such as business accelerators, partnership programmes with global media companies, and accreditation from relevant government bodies.

**Challenge #3**

Ageing, healthcare and urban density are three perennial areas of improvement for Singapore. These national challenges can be solved by encouraging Singaporeans to harness multidisciplinary research capabilities, especially those of research institutes, institutes of higher learning, technology companies, inventors, engineers, technicians, and entrepreneurs.

A great source of encouragement is a challenge. Like bargaining at a clothing shop in Far East Plaza, challenges can draw out the best in people. Thus, we need to launch tech challenges for the infocomm media sector. With a challenge as a target of focus, infocomm media professionals will be more motivated to concoct innovative solutions to the three aforementioned national challenges.

**Challenge #4**

As Benjamin Franklin noted, “Well done is better than well said.” Thus, we promote Singapore as a “Living Lab” for companies (both local and foreign) to develop, test and commercialise innovative infocomm media solutions. Judging an innovation’s quality in a real-life setting saves companies valuable time, because should that innovation fail, companies can move on to concocting another innovation with no regrets.

To augment the effort in developing Singapore as a “Living Lab”, physical spaces meant for spurring innovation with infocomm media should be created. One such example is&nbsp;**Creators’ Space**, a physical environment meant for helping media SMEs keep pace with technological advancement in digital and online video productions.
