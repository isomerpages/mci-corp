The Digital Economy has generated strong growth for Singapore. In particular, the Information and Communications (I&amp;C) sector has grown by 13.4% and 8.6% in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

**Equipping Businesses to seize opportunities in a digital future**

MCI will continue to support digital transformation of our businesses, particularly to help Small-Medium Enterprises improve their productivity and access new markets. We will scale adoption of digital utilities that support core business functions, such as e-payment and e-invoicing. We will also refresh the schemes to help firms improve their cybersecurity posture and raise their overall digital maturity. These will be brought together under the new&nbsp;**Digital Enterprise Blueprint**, a comprehensive guide to the Government’s support for enterprise digitalisation. We will also work with partners to shape international rules, benchmarks, and norms, through Digital Economy Agreements and other initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Empowering Singaporeans through reskilling and upskilling to access good tech jobs**

MCI will continue to help Singaporeans raise their digital proficiencies, both to access digital services and navigate confidently online, as well as to access good opportunities in tech. Initiatives under the Information and Communications Jobs Transformation Map will equip tech workers with the tools to stay competitive. We will also help workers, both within the information and communications sector and across the economy, upskill and deepen their proficiencies in high-demand areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we will work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education, as well as industry partners, to ensure that good opportunities remain accessible to all, through initiatives such as the TechSkills Accelerator for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance.




Infocomm Media
--------------
Infocomm media convergence has changed the way the infocomm and media sector is organised. MCI and IMDA work together to ensure our businesses and people seize the opportunities brought about by this convergence, and that the regulatory environment keep pace with the developments, remains conducive for businesses and protect consumers’ interests.

[Introduction to Infocomm Media 2025](#section1)

[Strategic Thrust 1: Capitalise on big data and advanced digital-age technologies](#section2)


[Strategic Thrust 2: Foster risk-taking and willingness to experiment](#section3)

<h2 id="section1">Introduction to Infocomm Media 2025</h2>

Imagine streaming high-definition web videos smoothly on your tablet PC via free Wi-Fi at Coney Island, while your smartwatch buzzes whenever necessary to notify you of an imminent thunderstorm. This is just one of many possibilities that will be realised with&nbsp;**Infocomm Media 2025**, Singapore’s bold vision for her infocomm media sector.

Developed by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI), the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore (IDA) and the Media Development Authority of Singapore (MDA), this 10-year plan released in Aug 2015, consists of three strategic thrusts:

1.  Build on the power of data and data insights, advanced communications and computational technologies to catalyse transformation across key sectors of our economy.
2.  Develop a future-ready workforce that embraces risk-taking and innovation.
3.  Deploy infocomm media technologies in a people-centric manner.

Given current technological constraints and pragmatic concerns, realising&nbsp;**Infocomm Media 2025**&nbsp;is not going to be quick and easy. But within the next decade or so, we are confident that Singapore’s research and development (R&amp;D) efforts will pay off, and produce the promising technologies necessary for&nbsp;**Infocomm Media 2025**&nbsp;to be implemented.


<h2 id="section2">Strategic Thrust 1: Capitalise on big data and advanced digital-age technologies</h2>

**Summary**

In order to bring you more personalised services, world-class Internet connectivity all over the island, compelling local TV content and more, hastening Singapore’s transformation into a world-class digital economy is necessary.

This will be done by tapping into the power of big data (the crude oil of the 21st&nbsp;century), and simultaneously establishing a highly advanced and secure infocomm media infrastructure that boosts Singapore’s competitiveness in the global digital economy.

**Challenge #1**

A speedy flow of information to anyone, anywhere, anytime will be the norm in the future. It facilitates better collection, transportation and sharing of data to keep Singapore’s digital economy running. But achieving it is easier said than done, for presently, a number of technological barriers in wireless communications still have to be overcome before our communications infrastructure is ready.&nbsp;

<h2 id="section3">Strategic Thrust 2: Foster risk-taking and willingness to experiment</h2>

**Summary**

A Smart Nation is only as smart as its people in the infocomm media ecosystem. Hence, we have to equip our students and workforce with the essential knowledge and skills they need to perform in high-value infocomm media jobs.

At the same time, we must instill in them the willingness to take risks, and an innovative attitude that would make any dedicated scientist proud. With such “software” installed, Singapore’s infocomm media sector should be capable of producing more successful made-in-Singapore content, products and services.

To further stimulate local creativity, we must create a conducive environment (i.e., a sustainable support network) for aspiring start-ups and growth companies.
