The Digital Economy has generated strong growth for Singapore. In particular, the Information and Communications (I&amp;C) sector has grown by 13.4% and 8.6% in 2021 and 2022 respectively.

**Equipping Businesses to seize opportunities in a digital future**

MCI will continue to support digital transformation of our businesses, particularly to help Small-Medium Enterprises improve their productivity and access new markets. We will scale adoption of digital utilities that support core business functions, such as e-payment and e-invoicing. We will also refresh the schemes to help firms improve their cybersecurity posture and raise their overall digital maturity. These will be brought together under the new&nbsp;**Digital Enterprise Blueprint**, a comprehensive guide to the Governmentâ€™s support for enterprise digitalisation. We will also work with partners to shape international rules, benchmarks, and norms, through Digital Economy Agreements and other initiatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**Empowering Singaporeans through reskilling and upskilling to access good tech jobs**

MCI will continue to help Singaporeans raise their digital proficiencies, both to access digital services and navigate confidently online, as well as to access good opportunities in tech. Initiatives under the Information and Communications Jobs Transformation Map will equip tech workers with the tools to stay competitive. We will also help workers, both within the information and communications sector and across the economy, upskill and deepen their proficiencies in high-demand areas such as 5G, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. As part of the Forward Singapore exercise, we will work with the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Education, as well as industry partners, to ensure that good opportunities remain accessible to all, through initiatives such as the TechSkills Accelerator for ITE and Polytechnics Alliance.
