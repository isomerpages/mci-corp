Digital Readiness Blueprint
---------------------------

The Digital Readiness Blueprint sets out recommendations for building Digital Readiness in Singaporeans, guided by four strategic thrusts.

<details>
<summary>Find out more</summary>
 
**#1: Expand and Enhance Digital Access for Inclusivity**

A basic part of being digitally ready is having in place the means to access online information, networks and communities. Access is no longer just about having computing devices and internet connectivity. We are increasingly finding that to transact in the electronically-connected world today, there are more digital elements which we use almost daily (see&nbsp;**Figure 1**&nbsp;below):&nbsp;

*   **Devices:**&nbsp;The Singapore Government has been providing computers and tablets at&nbsp;subsidised rates to low-income households. In today’s society, the use of mobile devices is becoming increasingly prevalent, perhaps even more so than computers.

*   **Connectivity:**&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not limited to fixed home broadband access, but also mobile broadband and widespread wireless connectivity.&nbsp;

*   **ePayment:**&nbsp;As countries around the world start grappling with new modes of payment, citizens likewise need not just cash, but also bank accounts linked to card facilities, e-wallets, and so on, which enable electronic or cashless payments.

*   **Digital Identities:** &nbsp;As services and products become increasingly digitalised, a secure way of transacting and authenticating one’s digital persona becomes increasingly critical. This could range from personal email addresses to authentication means such as the National Digital Identity ecosystem for government digital services.&nbsp;

**Recommendations:**&nbsp;

*   Make access to basic digital enablers as widespread as possible

*   Customise access package for those with specific needs

**#2: Infuse Digital Literacy into National Consciousness**

A digital society is one where citizens not only have access to technology, but also embrace it, utilising technology confidently and effectively to connect with the world around them. Digital Literacy is defined here as having the skills, confidence and motivation to use technology, and is key to our journey towards our Smart Nation vision.  
  
Besides an appreciation of what digital technology can do and the know-how to use it, digital literacy is also about being able to think critically about the information that one has received. With the proliferation of fake news, being able to discern misinformation has become even more important.&nbsp;  
  
**Recommendations:**&nbsp;

*   Identify a set of basic digital skills for everyday activities to spur take-up of digital technology, especially among the less digitally savvy (see&nbsp;**Figure 2**&nbsp;below)
*   Strengthen focus on information and media literacy, to build resilience in an era of online falsehoods
*   Ensure that our children and youth grow up to form meaningful relationships with people around them and use technology to benefit their communities

**#3: Empower Community and Businesses to Drive Widespread Adoption of Technology**

To thrive in a technology-rich society, it is not sufficient for people to just be consumers of technology. Instead they should be familiar with new technologies and be motivated and confident to use them to create products, content and services, and connect with their communities. In order to promote motivation and confidence, Singaporeans must be given the opportunities to participate, create, and connect with one another using technology.  
  
**Recommendations:**&nbsp;

*   Encourage private and people sector organisations to amplify efforts and help more Singaporeans adopt technology.
*   Provide one-on-one assistance to make it easy for Singaporeans to adopt technology, especially those who find it challenging.&nbsp;
*   Provide support for projects that create opportunities for community participation. For example, businesses and communities can take part in projects under the&nbsp;[Digital for Life movement](https://www.imda.gov.sg/digitalforlife)&nbsp;to enable all Singaporeans to enjoy a better quality of life through digitalisation.

**#4: Promote Digital Inclusion by Design**

Whether it is an app, website, or workshop, digital initiatives must be designed in a way that makes it easy for everyone to get involved. The design, content, language and the applicability of the initiative to people’s lives will go a long way in making sure that everyone can participate in our digital journey.&nbsp;  
  
Inclusion by design also goes beyond that, which is directly digital. Policies and regulations that may hamper digital adoption may also need to be assessed and reviewed. There is also an equally important need to understand some of the impediments or "frictions" that prevents people from using digital products and services, so that, so that we can&nbsp;overcome them to create a better ecosystem which supports the move towards a Smart Nation, both for consumers and businesses.  
  
**Recommendations:**&nbsp;

*   Encourage organisations to design for digital inclusion
*   Reach out to more Singaporeans by ensuring that relevant digital services are made available in vernacular languages
