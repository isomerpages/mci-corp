# **Building a Safe and Inclusive Digital Society**
The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) aims to build a safe and inclusive society where Singaporeans are empowered and equipped with skills to harness opportunities and benefit from digital developments. 

MCI works with its agencies, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) and National Library Board (NLB), to oversee and drive programmes and initiatives to ensure that Singaporeans, especially vulnerable segments, are equipped with: 

*   internet connectivity and digital devices needed for participation in digital society 
    
*   digital literacy and skills, and have the confidence, and motivation to use technology in their daily lives. 

MCI also recognises that a “digital first, but not digital only” approach is important to ensure that no one is left behind and everyone can participate in the increasingly digital society, regardless of their digital ability.

**Digital Readiness Blueprint**

The Digital Readiness Blueprint (to add link to blueprint pdf), published in 2018, sets out recommendations for building Digital Readiness in Singaporeans, guided by four strategic thrusts:

#1: Expand and Enhance Digital Access for Inclusivity
#2: Infuse Digital Literacy into National Consciousness
#3: Empower Community and Businesses to Drive Widespread Adoption of Technology
#4: Promote Digital Inclusion by Design

**People-Private-Public (3P) Approach to Build a Digitally Inclusive Society**
  
*  To galvanise people, private, and public sectors (3P) partnerships and help Singaporeans enrich their lives by embracing digital as a lifelong pursuit, the [Digital for Life (DfL) movement](https://www.digitalforlife.gov.sg/) was launched in 2021 as a national movement with the President as its Patron. Under the movement, the [DfL Fund](https://www.imda.gov.sg/digitalforlife/funding#donating-to-our-cause) was also set up to support digital inclusion initiatives by charities and other community groups. The movement calls for organisations and individuals to champion projects and activities that promote (1) Digital Technology and Inclusion and (2) Digital Literacy and Wellness.
	
	
# **Digital Access**

**Digital Access Schemes**

Digital access support is provided to vulnerable segments through [Digital Access Schemes](https://eservice.imda.gov.sg/das/homepage) by IMDA.

*   The **DigitalAccess@Home** **scheme** provides subsidised broadband and laptops/tablets to lower-income households to support their lifestyle needs, including work and social activities.
*   The **Mobile Access for Seniors (MAS) scheme** provides subsidised smartphones and mobile data plans for seniors who want to go digital but cannot afford to do so. 

**Free Internet Access in Public Spaces**

[Wireless@SG](https://www.imda.gov.sg/how-we-can-help/wireless-at-sg) by IMDA provides free Wi-Fi access in public spaces, in collaboration with venue owners and service providers. 

All library members may enjoy free access to NLB eResources and 1 hour of free Internet access daily at the Multimedia Stations in the libraries (except library@chinatown and library@orchard). 

**Technology Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities**

Tech Able, an initiative by SG Enable and SPD, is an integrated assistive technology space at the Enabling Village. It features a technology exhibition for persons with disabilities and provides them with assistive device assessment services. Persons with disabilities can find out about devices that will help them in their employment or daily activities.

**Provision of Non-digital Alternatives**  

Government initiatives to equip citizens with digital access and skills are complemented with efforts to support citizens who may still be unwilling and/or unable to transact digitally. 

Many Government agencies currently provide in-person and contact centre services, to assist those who may have difficulty transacting online.   

The Public Service has also set up ServiceSG Centres at various heartland locations, to serve as first-stop physical service touchpoints where officers can guide citizens through digital transactions and offer integrated services across different public agencies for citizens.

# **Digital Literacy**

**Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework**

The Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework (last updated in 2019) guides digital literacy programme owners and public agencies in planning media literacy and information literacy programmes.

The Media Literacy Council (MLC) seeks to encourage the public to become discerning media consumers with the ability to effectively evaluate, use, create, and share content safely and responsibly. MLC’s Better Internet Campaign has been re-positioned under the Digital Wellness (DW) campaign in 2021 led by the national Digital for Life movement.

The curriculum comprises 1-to-1 and small group lessons at the SG Digital Community Hubs and Learning Journeys to guide seniors in real world applications of digital skills.  

**SG Cyber Safe Seniors Programme**

**Cyber Wellness Education**

Cyber Wellness in MOE’s Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum focuses on the well-being of students as they navigate cyberspace. The CCE curriculum aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills to harness the power of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for positive purposes, maintain a positive presence in cyberspace and be safe and responsible users of ICT.

**Code For Fun** 

The Code for Fun Enrichment Programme (offered jointly by MOE and IMDA) aims to increase primary and secondary school students’ exposure to coding and computational thinking. Students learn computational thinking, coding concepts and emerging technology through engaging hands-on experiences, robotic kits and/or microcontrollers.
