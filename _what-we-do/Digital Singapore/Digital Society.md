Comprising representatives from the public, private and people sectors, the digital readiness initiative aim to develop strategies and principles for building digital readiness for Singaporeans, with a particular emphasis on those who might be at risk of being excluded from opportunities in the digital future.

If you have any suggestions on how we can work together towards a digitally ready Singapore, or if you would like to contribute to this effort in any way, we would be happy to hear from you.
