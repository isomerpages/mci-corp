## Building a resilient and trusted cyber environment

Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy aims to build a trusted cyber environment, to realise the benefits of technology and secure a better future for Singaporeans. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and the Cyber Security Agency (CSA) work with government agencies and private organisations to build resilient infrastructure, create a safer cyberspace, develop a vibrant cyber ecosystem and strengthen international partnerships.

## Personal Data Protection

The Ministry of Communications and Information, through the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC) in the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), oversees and crafts policies to strengthen Singapore’s personal data protection regime. It aims to raise awareness of the importance of data protection among Singaporeans and assist businesses in building up their data protection capacity.

## Digital Defence

Digital Defence is one of the six pillars of Total Defence, to guard against threats from the digital domain.

### Why Digital Defence?  
  
Singapore is an open and connected city-state. As individuals, we are constantly connected through online networks.    
  
New threats from the digital domain can breach data systems and threaten social cohesion. We must evolve our skills and instincts to defend ourselves.  
  
### Be Secure  
  
Individuals and businesses can be secure by practising good cybersecurity habits to safeguard data and devices.

### Be Responsible  
  
We can be responsible by being mindful when producing or sharing content which may impact our community.  
  
Fake news are becoming increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, and they can be difficult to detect. If we think that a piece of information may be untrue, we can play our part in not propagating fake news by not posting or forwarding it.
