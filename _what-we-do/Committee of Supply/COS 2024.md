## Paving the Way Towards Our Digital Future

“A Smart Nation that we can trust, helps us grow, and keeps us together”

Today, Singaporeans embrace the use of digital technologies in their daily lives. Many are also open to trying out new technologies. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) will create a trusted environment where Singaporeans can use technology with confidence and continue to benefit from developments in technology.

At the Committee of Supply 2024 debates, MCI outlines plans to pave the way towards our digital future. Through Artificial Intelligence (AI) initiatives to power Singapore’s next bound of economic growth, the development of our digital infrastructure, and measures to strengthen Singaporeans’ trust and confidence in the digital domain, we hope everyone can thrive in our digital future.

### Uplift Economic Potential Through Digital

The Government will invest more than S$1 billion over the next five years into AI compute, talent, and industry development. MCI will build capabilities in our people and businesses to seize opportunities in an AI-enabled future.

### Preserve Trust in The Digital & Information Domains

Singaporeans depend on the digital infrastructure and services that meet their day-to-day needs and power our digital economy. To preserve trust in our digital domain, MCI will enhance the resilience of Singapore's digital infrastructure and services, foster an environment where AI will be used responsibly and ethically, and strengthen Public Service Media to guard against rising threats of misinformation.
