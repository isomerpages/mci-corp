Research and test messaging
---------------------------

MCI conducts extensive research to improve the way it communicates to the public.

### Evidence-based Research

MCI uses a wide range of evidence-based research methods to better understand public sentiment, attitudes and behaviour. 

Using evidence-based research, MCI gathers insights that help drive Whole-of-Government policy formulation and communication strategies. This helps us understand public sentiment on issues, and to assess public awareness of, and response to, specific government policies and programmes.

MCI is method-neutral in conducting its research, employing a range of tools including:

•            Surveys (e.g. door-to-door, telephone, online)

•            Focus group discussions

•            Behavioural insights

•            Media trends and analytics

**Post-Budget 2015 Poll**

More than 7 in 10 Singaporeans supported Budget 2015 initiatives, with significant support for the Silver Support Scheme, SkillsFuture, enhanced subsidies and bursaries for education, GST Voucher-Seniors’ Bonus, and changes to personal income tax for top earners. A poll to gauge Singaporeans’ responses to Budget 2015 was conducted through Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) from 25 February to 6 March 2015. Around 950 randomly selected citizens aged 20 and above were polled, and the sample was weighted to be demographically representative of the national population.

A poll to better understand views towards the new Bill was conducted through Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) from 20 to 26 January 2015.

A Computer-Assisted Telephone Interviews (CATI) poll was conducted from 29 February to 4 March 2016 to better understand public transport sentiments. Some 1,200 randomly selected Singapore residents aged 15 and above were polled, with the sample weighted to be representative of the national population.

### Media analytics

MCI conducts research on media trends and habits to better understand how to reach and engage different groups of Singaporeans.

This includes assessing the effectiveness of media channels for communicating policies to different segments of Singaporeans. MCI also evaluates the effectiveness of government agencies’ digital platforms and the usefulness of Government feedback channels.

### Policy and message testing

Using reliable data, MCI works closely with government agencies to support national policy making. 

Part of MCI’s research also includes message testing to assess how policies and initiatives resonate with various segments of the population. These allow us to adjust the way we deliver government services, to better meet the needs of citizens.
