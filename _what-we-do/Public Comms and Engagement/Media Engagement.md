## Manage government media relations

MCI handles communications within the government as well as with various media outlets.

### Objectives

1. Support the daily functions of government communications.
2. Facilitate media reporting in Singapore.

### Role in government events

MCI coordinates and manages communications for a number of whole-of-government events. Some of these events include the SG50 celebrations, ‘The Future of Us’ exhibition, and the State Funeral of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

**SG50 celebrations**

SG50 was a nationwide effort to celebrate Singapore’s 50 years of independence, and was aimed at rekindling the Singapore spirit among Singaporeans.

**‘The Future of Us’ exhibition**

‘The Future of Us’ exhibition was the capstone event that rounded up Singapore’s SG50 year of celebrations. Held from 1 December 2015 at Gardens by the Bay, the immersive, interactive and multi-sensory experience gave Singaporeans a glimpse into possibilities of the future.

## Reporting in Singapore
  
### Establishing a news bureau  
  
Media organisations that wish to set up a news bureau in Singapore have to apply to the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) for approval. To do so, please email MCI’s Media Division ([mci_duty_officer@mci.gov.sg](mailto:mci_duty_officer@mci.gov.sg)) with the following information:   
  
* Letter of request from the media organisation, printed on its letterhead    
* Background information of the media organisation    
* CV of correspondent(s)  
  
Please indicate whether the news bureau will be engaging in other activities besides news gathering and reporting. If the news bureau engages only in news gathering and reporting, it will be considered a representative office and does not need to be registered as a business.  If the bureau also engages in other activities, such as the selling of news, then a business office has to be set up. For this, please contact:
