In the event of a Godzilla attack or a Zika outbreak in Singapore, we suggest that you make [Gov.sg](https://www.gov.sg/) your first stop for information on Government’s response. In times of crisis, we will keep you updated on the latest news and the best way to keep yourself and your loved ones safe. Even if there’s no crisis at hand, we are a good resource for information on key Government announcements.

We only serve the facts here on Gov.sg. If you’ve been hearing a lot of rumours and what you suspect is misinformation on the Singapore Government, just head on over to Factually on Gov.sg. We’ll clear up your doubts. Don’t be shy, we’re just a click away.

If websites are not your thing, we are also on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/gov.sg), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/govsingapore) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/govsingapore). Post a comment and send us a question. We would love to hear from you!
