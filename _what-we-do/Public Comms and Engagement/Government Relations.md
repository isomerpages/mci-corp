Manage government media relations
---------------------------------

MCI handles communications within the government as well as with various media outlets.

### Objectives

1.  Support the daily functions of government communications.
2.  Facilitate media reporting in Singapore.

### Role in government events

MCI coordinates and manages communications for a number of whole-of-government events. Some of these events include the SG50 celebrations, ‘The Future of Us’ exhibition, and the State Funeral of Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

**SG50 celebrations**

SG50 was a nationwide effort to celebrate Singapore’s 50 years of independence, and was aimed at rekindling the Singapore spirit among Singaporeans.

**‘The Future of Us’ exhibition**

‘The Future of Us’ exhibition was the capstone event that rounded up Singapore’s SG50 year of celebrations. Held from 1 December 2015 at Gardens by the Bay, the immersive, interactive and multi-sensory experience gave Singaporeans a glimpse into possibilities of the future.

**State Funeral of Mr Lee Kuan Yew**

The funeral service for Singapore’s first Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, was held at the University Cultural Centre (UCC), National University of Singapore on 29 March 2015, Sunday, from 2pm to 5.15pm. It was preceded by the state funeral procession from the Parliament House to the UCC.

### Role in regional events

A total of 17 editors and journalists from ASEAN states participated in the programme and had the opportunity to interview Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and Minister of Finance Heng Swee Keat. The group also generated several news articles on Singapore’s governance and policies that helped our ASEAN friends develop a better understanding of Singapore.

MCI organises MCI Press Cocktails, which are annual receptions hosted by the Minister to allow senior MCI management as well as government-wide information officers to network with media representatives from Singapore and international media based here.

Strengthen Whole-of-Government Crisis Communications Preparedness
-----------------------------------------------------------------

During a national crisis, MCI coordinates public communications across the government to effectively manage and respond to the incident. MCI also works with key ministries and agencies on crisis planning to enhance their processes and approaches towards public communications and information management.

Communicating policies to the public
------------------------------------

MCI ensures that policies are communicated clearly, and Singaporeans understand how they will benefit from them. Examples of policies we have communicated include: Pioneer Generation Package, Medishield Life and retirement planning.

Inform and engage Singaporeans on national and social issues
------------------------------------------------------------

Our work involves keeping the public informed and engaged, on challenges Singapore faces, what the government is doing to address them, and how the public can play a part.
