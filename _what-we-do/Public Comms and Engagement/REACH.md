**What is REACH?**

REACH is the lead agency facilitating whole-of-government efforts to engage and connect with Singaporeans on national and social issues.

**How has REACH evolved over the years?**

REACH started as the Singapore Government’s Feedback Unit (FBU) in 1985. In 2006, FBU was restructured and renamed REACH as it moved towards actively engaging and connecting with Singaporeans on national issues and policies. REACH was appointed the Government’s e-engagement platform in 2009.

With the restructuring of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) and the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA) in 2012, REACH was transferred from MCYS to the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) to take on a more proactive role in advocating and sustaining whole-of-government engagement efforts.

**How do I share my feedback on REACH?**

Singaporeans can share their views through these methods:

*   [REACH Singapore’s Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/REACHSingapore/)
*   [REACH Online Feedback Form](https://www.reach.gov.sg/about-us/contact-us/feedback-form)
*   Post: 140 Hill Street, #01-01A, Old Hill Street Police Station, Singapore 179369

**What happens to the feedback received on REACH?**

All feedback sent to REACH, regardless of the sentiments expressed, is read by REACH staff. REACH will convey the feedback, in its entirety, to the relevant ministries and agencies for consideration in their review of policies and issues.

**Other ways of seeking feedback: Public Consultations**

Government agencies consult the public to seek views and ideas from citizens and relevant stakeholders on new policies or a change to an existing policy. Ministries and agencies will post their public consultation paper on REACH’s Public Consultation Portal and/or their agency’s website for members of the public to comment. To gather deeper insights on the policy proposals, ministries and agencies may also engage relevant stakeholders through surveys, polls and focus group discussions.
