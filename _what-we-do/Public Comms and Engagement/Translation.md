### SG Translate Together Web Portal

* The [SG Translate Together (SGTT)](https://www.sgtranslatetogether.gov.sg/) Web Portal allows members of the public to generate localised first-cut translations and contribute post-edited translation data to improve the accuracy of the SG Translate Machine Translation (MT) engine. This engine was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and A\*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), with the support of the TRANS Grant. 
* The registered users, known as Citizen Translators, can edit the MT generated translations and submit them for review. These reviewed translations will be used to further train the MT engine.
* The portal serves as a one-stop platform for the translation community, where they can develop their translation skills, utilise translation resources, share their insights with one another and stay updated on translation-related programmes and events.

### Citizen Translators Project

* As part of the Government’s efforts to raise the overall translation and language standards in Singapore, the Ministry of Communications and Information soft-launched the Citizen Translators (CT) Project in Jan 2021, to encourage volunteers with passion in language and translation to join as CTs. 
* The project is a first in Singapore involving members of the public, and aims to harness the expertise of the community to crowdsource the best translations for Government communications materials, localised to Singapore’s context. 
* It also provides a platform for volunteers to build formal and informal networks to share experiences and knowledge to improve translation competencies.
 
### Promoting best practices

**Whole-of-Government Period Contract and Framework Agreement (WoG PCFA) for Translation Services**

Introduced on 7 May 2015, the framework provides a list of translation vendors who have been evaluated for quality and price competitiveness. With this framework, government agencies will be able to procure quality translations at a fair rate with a quicker turn-around time.

**Government Terms Translated**

MCI’s Translation Department maintains the Government Terms Translated repository, which agencies, translation companies and the public can refer to for translations of Government policy-related terms in the four official languages. Click [here](https://www.translatedterms.gov.sg/)&nbsp;to visit the repository.

### Nurturing talent

**Information Service (Translation) Scholarship** 

In 2015, MCI introduced the Information Service (Translation) Scholarship, aimed at identifying and grooming young Singaporeans who have a strong interest in translation as well as a deep familiarity with Singapore’s translation landscape and context. Click [here](/join-us/scholarship/overview/) for more information on the Information Service (Translation) Scholarship.

### Translation Talent Development Scheme (TTDS)

* Launched in 2018, the TTDS is an initiative to support Singapore translation and interpretation (T&amp;I) practitioners from the private sector in deepening their skills. 

* Awarded recipients can receive up to S$10,000, to offset 90 percent of the expenses incurred in their participation of capability development programme(s) related to translation, interpretation and/or languages in Singapore and overseas.
