### SG Translate Together Web Portal

<div style="position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;"> <iframe style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" align="center" allowfullscreen="" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" frameborder="0" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-OYRSf0Kx_Y" height="315" width="560"></iframe> </div>

* The [SG Translate Together (SGTT)](https://www.sgtranslatetogether.gov.sg/) Web Portal allows members of the public to generate localised first-cut translations and contribute post-edited translation data to improve the accuracy of the SG Translate Machine Translation (MT) engine. This engine was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and A\*STAR’s Institute for Infocomm Research (I<sup>2</sup>R), with the support of the TRANS Grant. 
* The registered users, known as Citizen Translators, can edit the MT generated translations and submit them for review. These reviewed translations will be used to further train the MT engine.
* The portal serves as a one-stop platform for the translation community, where they can develop their translation skills, utilise translation resources, share their insights with one another and stay updated on translation-related programmes and events.

### Citizen Translators Project

*   The Citizen Translators (CT) Project was introduced in 2021, as part of the Government’s efforts to raise the overall translation and language standards in Singapore. An initiative under the National Translation Committee and part of the SG Together Movement, theproject is a first in Singapore involving members of the public, and aims to harness the expertise of the community to crowdsource the best translations for government communications materials.&nbsp;
*   Interested parties may sign up as a CT by registering on the SGTT portal [here](https://www.sgtranslatetogether.gov.sg/).
 
### Promoting best practices

**Whole-of-Government Period Contract and Framework Agreement (WoG PCFA) for Translation Services**

Introduced on 7 May 2015, the framework provides a list of translation vendors who have been evaluated for quality and price competitiveness. With this framework, government agencies will be able to procure quality translations at a fair rate with a quicker turn-around time.

**Government Terms Translated**

MCI’s Translation Department maintains the Government Terms Translated repository, which agencies, translation companies and the public can refer to for translations of Government policy-related terms in the four official languages. Click [here](https://www.translatedterms.gov.sg/) to visit the repository.

### Nurturing talent

In 2015, MCI introduced the Information Service (Translation) Scholarship, aimed at identifying and grooming young Singaporeans who have a strong interest in translation as well as a deep familiarity with Singapore’s translation landscape and context.
