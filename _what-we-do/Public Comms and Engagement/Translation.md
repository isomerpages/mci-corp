### Community-in-Translation Events Grant

* As part of the NTC’s efforts to raise translation standards in Singapore, the Community-in-Translation initiative was launched in 2016 to reach out and engage the community through translation-related activities.

* The Community-in-Translation Events Grant (CiTEG) provides funding support for ground-up events with a strong translation element.&nbsp;

* Interested applicants can submit applications for funding to defray expenses in organising translation-focused events featuring English, Chinese, Malay and/or Tamil.
