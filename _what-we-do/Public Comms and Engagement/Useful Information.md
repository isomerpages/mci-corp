## Reporting in Singapore

### Establishing a news bureau

Media organisations that wish to set up a news bureau in Singapore have to apply to the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) for approval. To do so, please email MCI’s Media Division [mci_duty_officer@mci.gov.sg](mailto:mci_duty_officer@mci.gov.sg) with the following information:

* Letter of request from the media organisation, printed on its letterhead  
* Background information of the media organisation  
* CV of correspondent(s)

Please indicate whether the news bureau will be engaging in other activities besides news gathering and reporting. If the news bureau engages only in news gathering and reporting, it will be considered a representative office and does not need to be registered as a business.  If the bureau also engages in other activities, such as the selling of news, then a business office has to be set up. For this, please contact:

[Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority](https://www.acra.gov.sg/)

### Work Passes

Foreigners who intend to work in Singapore must have a valid work pass (commonly known as a work visa) before they start work. Please visit the [Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s website](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits) for more information on the various types of work pass, eligibility criteria, and application process.  

Foreign media personnel on short-term assignments (up to 60 days) which are not supported or sponsored by any Singapore government agency are required to apply for a Miscellaneous Work Pass (MWP) via MOM’s [website](http://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/miscellaneous-work-pass/apply-for-a-pass). 

For enquiries on work pass matters, please contact MOM’s Work Pass Division at [mom_wpd@mom.gov.sg](mailto:mom_wpd@mom.gov.sg).

### Press Accreditation

Media personnel working in Singapore may apply for a press accreditation card (PAC) from MCI. The PAC identifies you as a bona fide media and provides access to government information and events.  

**Eligibility**

* Media personnel who regularly cover government events, such as editors, journalists, photographers, camera crew  
* Applicants must be full-time employees of an accredited news organisation  
* MCI does not accredit media personnel from specialised publications  
* Contract staff, temporary staff, interns and freelancers are not eligible to apply for a PAC

To apply for Media Organisation Accreditation or a PAC, please visit the [PAC Online website](http://paconline.gov.sg). For enquiries on press accreditation, email: [MCI_PAC_Online@mci.gov.sg](mailto:MCI_PAC_Online@mci.gov.sg).
