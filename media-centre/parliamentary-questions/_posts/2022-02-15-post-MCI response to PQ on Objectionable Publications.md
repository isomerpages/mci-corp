<h3>Parliament Sitting on 15 February 2022</h3>
<h2>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h2>
<br>
<strong>28. <strong><span style="color: black;">Mr Leon Perera</span></strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong></strong>To ask the Minister for Communications and Information whether the Ministry will consider asking online service providers to insert advisories on all posts relating to illegal drugs on the harmful effects on potential users and the severe penalty that one will face in trafficking such drugs into Singapore.<br>
<br>
<strong>Answer:<br>
<br>

<div>1.<span style="white-space: pre;">		</span>IMDA’s database enables registered importers and distributors to check if a publication has been disallowed, before they proceed with purchases and distribution of the publication. Importers, publishers and retailers essentially self-regulate based on the Undesirable Publications Act (UPA) and IMDA’s content guidelines, which are available on IMDA’s website. IMDA steps in when there is public feedback or complaints, or when importers refer publications to IMDA for advice. The database therefore only contains titles that IMDA has reviewed. As it is not exhaustive, making it available for public reference might lead the public to wrongly rely on it. Nevertheless, anyone who is in doubt on whether a publication they intend to distribute may be considered objectionable, can approach IMDA for advice.</div>
