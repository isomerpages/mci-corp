<h3>Parliament Sitting on 28 November 2022</h3>
<h2>QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>32. Mr Melvin Yong Yik Chye:</strong> To ask the Minister for Communications and Information arising from IMDA's inaugural publication of statistics on telecommunication service providers' handling of consumer feedback (a) what will be done to improve the service quality of the poorest performing telcos; and (b) whether IMDA will impose on telcos a maximum waiting time for their hotline or live chat to better protect consumers' interests.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>IMDA seeks to enable a vibrant and competitive telecommunications market, in order to improve service quality and to protect consumers’ interests.<br>
<br>
2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>In this regard, IMDA’s inaugural publication of statistics on telecommunication service providers’ handling of consumer feedback, is a new initiative that provides increased transparency on an important aspect of telecommunication service providers’ performance.&nbsp;This is intended to help consumers make more informed decisions when choosing a service provider. IMDA has also published other performance reports, for example, the publication of statistics on service providers' network quality performance, since 2007.<br>
<br>
3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> 		</span>Telecommunication service providers are ultimately responsible for attending to their own customers and resolving their complaints. If they do not improve their customer service, consumers can and do vote with their feet and switch to other service providers. In addition, IMDA has set up an Alternative Dispute Resolution or ADR Scheme, to further incentivise telecommunication service providers to resolve contractual disputes with their consumers in a timely manner.&nbsp;Hence, IMDA will monitor service performance over time, including various customer service standards, to assess if improvements are made and if high standards are maintained.<strong><br>
