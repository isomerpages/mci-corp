<h3 style="text-align: justify;">Parliament Sitting on 30 November 2022</h3>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">QUESTION FOR WRITTEN ANSWER</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>37.<strong><span>&nbsp;Mr Leon Perera: </span></strong><span></span></strong><span>To ask the Minister for Communications and Information what recourse do visitors to commercial and private residential facilities have when security officers at these facilities ask to collect their NRIC numbers or other personally identifiable information in contravention of the Security Association Singapore and Personal Data Protection Commission guidelines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span><strong>Answer:</strong></span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">1. 		Security officers can check a visitor’s photo ID, such as one’s NRIC, during registration to verify their identity.&nbsp;To contact the visitors when necessary, they may also collect certain information such as name and contact number. For buildings or compounds that collect NRIC numbers, the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC)’s Advisory Guidelines for Management Corporations require them to implement tighter measures to secure the collected personal data.</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">2. 		If a visitor thinks that security officers have not observed PDPC guidelines, he or she should seek clarification from the Management Corporation’s Data Protection Officer and seek an amicable resolution of the matter. The visitor can lodge a complaint with the PDPC if the matter is not resolved.
