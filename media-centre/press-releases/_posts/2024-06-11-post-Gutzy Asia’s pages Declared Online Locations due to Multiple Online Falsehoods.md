<li>
<p>Gutzy Asia’s (“Gutzy”) website (<a href="https://gutzy.asia" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://gutzy.asia</a>) and Gutzy’s social media
pages on Facebook and X (formerly known as Twitter) (the “online locations”)
have been declared as Declared Online Locations1 (“DOLs”) under the Protection
from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act 2019 (“POFMA”). The Declaration
was issued by the Minister for Communications and Information on 11 June
2024 and will come into effect on 12 June 2024.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Declaration was made following multiple falsehoods communicated on
the online</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>locations. The Declaration will be in effect for two years, until 11 June
2026. During the period that</p>
<p>the Declaration is in effect, Gutzy’s website, Facebook page and X account
page, are each required</p>
<p>to carry a notice, stating that each of these online locations has been
declared as a DOL. With the</p>
<p>notice, visitors to these DOLs will be warned that Gutzy has a history
of communicating falsehoods</p>
<p>on these online locations (see Annex for details).</p>
<p>3. The Declaration does not mean that the DOLs will need to cease operations.
Gutzy’s</p>
<p>website, Facebook page and X account page may remain in operation. However,
the statutory</p>
<p>requirements under Part 5 POFMA relating to, amongst others, the de-monetisation
of the DOLs,</p>
<p>must be complied with. POFMA prohibits a person from deriving financial
benefit from operating a</p>
<p>DOL, thereby preventing operators of DOLs from profiting from the communication
of falsehoods.</p>
<p>4. During the time that the Declaration remains in effect:</p>
<p>a. It shall be an offence for the operator of the DOLs to derive financial
or other material</p>
<p>benefit from operating the online location.</p>
<p>b. Service providers2 and digital advertising intermediaries3 must take
reasonable steps to</p>
<p>ensure that paid content that they include or cause to be included on
the DOLs are not</p>
<p>communicated in Singapore.</p>
<p>c. Individuals4 and companies must not provide financial support to the
DOLs if they know</p>
<p>or have reason to believe that by doing so, they will support, help, or
promote the</p>
<p>communication of falsehoods in Singapore on the DOLs.</p>
<p>5. Members of the public are advised to be alert to Gutzy’s history of
communicating</p>
<p>misinformation on these online locations, and to fact-check information
published at these DOLs.</p>

<p>Annex</p>
<p>Overview of POFMA “Declared Online Locations”</p>
<p>1) Background on “Declared Online Locations”</p>
<p>• Under Section 32 of POFMA, an online location may be declared as a “Declared
Online</p>
<p>Location” (“DOL”) if:</p>
<p>i. It has carried three or more different false statements of fact that
are the subject</p>
<p>of active Part 3 or Part 4 Directions (e.g., POFMA Correction Directions);
and</p>
<p>ii. At least three of these false statements of fact had been communicated
on the</p>
<p>online location within six months before the date of the Declaration.</p>
<p>• A notice must be published in the Government Gazette when a Declaration
is issued. A</p>
<p>registry of DOLs can be found at the POFMA Office website.</p>
<p>• There are nine other online locations that are currently DOLs with effect
from 22 July 2023</p>
<p>up to 11 December 2025:</p>
<p>i. Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam’s (“Mr Jeyaretnam’s”) Facebook page,</p>
<p>ii. Mr Jeyaretnam’s Instagram page,</p>
<p>iii. Mr Jeyaretnam’s LinkedIn page,</p>
<p>iv. Mr Jeyaretnam’s X (formerly known as Twitter) account page,</p>
<p>v. The Ricebowl Singapore website,</p>
<p>vi. The Online Citizen Asia’s (“TOCA’s”) website,</p>
<p>vii. TOCA’s Facebook page,</p>
<p>viii. TOCA’s LinkedIn page, and</p>
<p>ix. TOCA’s X account page.</p>
<p>• The owner or operator of a DOL, or any person with editorial control
over the DOL, may</p>
<p>apply to the Minister for Communications and Information to vary or cancel
the declaration.</p>
<p>If the Minister refuses the application, an appeal can be made to the
High Court.</p>
<p>2) Correction Directions issued to Gutzy</p>
<p>• Gutzy’s website, Facebook page and X account page have each met the
requirements to</p>
<p>be declared as a DOL. Each of these online locations have communicated
at least three</p>
<p>different false statements of fact in Singapore, which are the subject
of three active POFMA</p>
<p>Correction Directions. Two of the three active POFMA Correction Directions
are in respect</p>
<p>of five false statements of fact which had first been communicated in
February 2024.</p>
