<p>Summary of the Asia Tech x Singapore (ATxSG) Government-to-Government
Roundtable on</p>
<p>Online Safety by Chair and Minister for Communications and Information</p>
<p>Mrs Josephine Teo, Friday, 31 May 2024</p>
<p>Sentosa, Singapore: Ministers and senior government officials from around
the world met today at</p>
<p>the ATxSummit for a closed-door Government-to-Government Roundtable discussion
on Online</p>
<p>Safety (“Roundtable”). Minister for Communications and Information and
Second Minister for</p>
<p>Home Affairs Mrs Josephine Teo, who Chaired the Roundtable, released the
following Chair’s</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>“At the Government-to-Government Roundtable on 31 May, we discussed the
topic of online safety,</p>
<p>with a focus on children safety, and AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes.
There was broad</p>
<p>consensus that there is an urgent need to curb the threat of online harms,
especially for vulnerable</p>
<p>groups, and for regulations to keep pace with advances in technologies,
such as generative AI. We</p>
<p>had a constructive exchange of views on how governments and policymakers
can foster a positive</p>
<p>and inclusive online environment that promotes trust, respect, and meaningful
participation for all</p>
<p>users.”</p>
<p>On online safety, with a focus on children safety, the Roundtable participants
reflected their</p>
<p>concern that children, who are spending more time online for learning,
entertainment and</p>
<p>connecting with others, are particularly vulnerable when exposed to inappropriate
content and</p>
<p>social interaction online. While industry has taken active steps in recent
years to combat online</p>
<p>harms on social media, participants agreed that tech companies, civil
society, and academia can</p>
<p>and should do more to put in place additional protections for children
or raise awareness of online</p>
<p>harms that they might face. They also highlighted the importance of education
and partnerships to</p>
<p>equip citizens, especially children and their parents, with the knowledge
and skills to use the</p>
<p>Internet responsibly and manage potential online harms. Participants reiterated
their commitment</p>
<p>to international collaboration, especially with the increasingly borderless
nature of online harms.</p>
<p>On AI-generated misinformation and deepfakes, the Roundtable participants
shared that an online</p>
<p>environment saturated with untrustworthy information can breed polarisation
and erode trust in</p>
<p>institutions. Participants emphasised the need to develop national and
global governance</p>
<p>frameworks to mitigate the misuse of AI in deepfakes and misinformation,
while still allowing</p>
<p>maximal space for innovation to take advantage of the opportunities which
AI offers. They also</p>
<p>shared the belief that developing technological safeguards and improving
digital literacy among</p>
<p>citizens can strengthen a country’s resilience to AI-generated misinformation
and deepfakes. A</p>
<p>coordinated approach that taps into the strength of all stakeholders is
imperative to nimbly</p>
<p>respond to these unprecedented harms in the information landscape.</p>
