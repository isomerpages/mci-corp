<p>1. The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) is seeking public
feedback on the <strong>Digital Enterprise Blueprint (DEB)</strong>. The
public consultation period is from <strong>04 April to 22 April 2024.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Background</u></strong>
</p>
<p>2. MCI is developing a Digital Enterprise Blueprint (DEB) to chart the
next bound of digitalisation for enterprises, amidst a rapidly evolving
technological landscape and fast-growing digital economy.</p>
<p>3. In the process of developing the DEB, MCI has consulted extensively
with industry and trade association partners. With insights from the consultations
and MCI agenciesâ€™ regular engagements and adoption surveys with the industry
and sector leads, MCI has developed an interim set of recommendations for
the DEB.</p>
<p>4. The recommendations focus on four key shifts to:</p>
<p>(a) Empower enterprises to be smarter in the way they work by leveraging
emerging technologies;</p>
<p>(b) Support enterprises to scale faster through digital solutions;</p>
<p>(c) Equip enterprises to be safer by improving their cyber resilience;
and</p>
<p>(d) Continue investing in our workers as core enablers of digitalisation.</p>
