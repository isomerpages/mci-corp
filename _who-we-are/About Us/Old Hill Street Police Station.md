The Old Hill Street Police Station (OHSPS), was erected in 1934 to house the Hill Street Police Station and Barracks. It was gazetted as a national monument in 1998 and transformed into comfortable and lively premises for the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts (MICA). MICA moved from PSA Building to the OHSPS which was renamed as the MICA Building in 2000.  
  
The building was later renamed as the Old Hill Street Police Station again in 2012, after MICA became the Ministry of Communication and Information. The OHSPS currently houses the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth as well.

### Did you know?

Before the construction of the Old Hill Street Police Station, the Assembly Rooms - a space for public functions and a building that housed a theatre and a school - occupied this site from 1845 to 1856. Originally built as a police station, the building was the largest government building and regarded as a modern skyscraper at the time of its completion in 1934.  
  
The steep slopes of Fort Canning had to be cut back and shored up, to provide vehicular access to the back entrance of the building.  
  
The building has a total of 927 windows and they are painted in the colours of the rainbow. Passersby will notice that the windows on the first four stories have the same vibrant intensity while the colours for the fifth- and sixth-story gradually intensify to accentuate the cantilevered balconies which are interesting architectural features of this historical building.
